# weather-classifier
This project employs machine learning techniques to classify weather conditions using diverse datasets, including MWD, ACDC, syndrone, and UAVid. The data preprocessing pipeline involves resizing, normalization, and label extraction from image filenames. Two Support Vector Machine (SVM) models are trained with RBF and Polynomial kernels.
